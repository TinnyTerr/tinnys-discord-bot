# Tinny's Discord Bot

Hi there! I'm tinny, a small developer working on a free discord bot. 
The wiki, found [here](https://github.com/TinnyTerr/tinnys-discord-bot/wiki) will contain further information about the commands, our roadmap and more. Have fun! 

## The Plan

Currently, the plan is to create a general purpose bot, fully customisable and open to the public. 
## Roadmap

- Create message customisation

- Run normal bot for non-code savy users

- Add premium system linked with your servers subscription

- And more!

## FAQ

#### Authorisation Error

Check your discord bots token, that error means it cant log in.

## Installation

Install my-project with npm

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TinnyTerr/tinnys-discord-bot.git
cd tinnys-discord-bot
npm Install
```

Once thats finished, open `config.json.example`, rename it to `config.json` and fill out the requirements, once filled, run `index.js` and it will tell you if it has logged in.
